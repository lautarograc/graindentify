# graindentify
A neural network intended to classify different types of grains.

This is my first big project.
The objective of this project is very simple:
I'm trying to create a convolutional neural network that is able to identify with an acceptable accuracy the type of grain presented from a prior image.

To train this CNN, I'm going to create a scrapper bot to search Google Images for adequate data points

Python is my language of choice for the entirety of this project.

This readme is going to be updated as I progress with the project.
