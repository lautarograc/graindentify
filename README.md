# graindentify
A neural network intended to classify different types of grains.

This is my first big project.
The objective of this project is very simple:
I'm trying to create a convolutional neural network that is able to identify with an acceptable accuracy the type of grain presented from a prior image.

To train this CNN, I'm going to create a scrapper bot to search Google Images for adequate data points

Python is my language of choice for the entirety of this project.

This CNN uses a xception deep nn model with 80-20 train/test relationship and reports 

I'm still trying to improve it mostly by obtaining more accurate, useful datapoints and by avoiding overfitting it. The high loss represents a difficult obstacle
in the mission to obtain meaningful results from this image classifier.
